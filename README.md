## ‚ö° Performance Optimizations

### Rendering Efficiency
- **Instanced Rendering**: Single draw call for all aircraft using `THREE.InstancedMesh`
- **Merged Geometry**: Combined flight paths in single `LineSegments` mesh
- **Conditional Updates**: Skip expensive operations when elements are hidden
- **Draw Range Optimization**: Only render visible flight paths

### Animation Optimizations
- **Selective Processing**: Stop flight animations when planes are hidden
- **Matrix Caching**: Skip matrix calculations for invisible elements
- **Visibility Checks**: Early returns prevent unnecessary GPU operations
- **Buffer Reuse**: Pre-allocated geometry buffers for maximum efficiency

### Memory Management
- **Geometry Sharing**: Reused plane geometry across instances
- **Texture Optimization**: SVG-to-canvas texture pipeline
- **Efficient Data Structures**: Float32Arrays for position/color data

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

- **Three.js**: 3D graphics and WebGL rendering
- **dat.GUI**: Interactive control panel
- **Stats.js**: Performance monitoring
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: ES6 modules with clean architecture

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser with WebGL support
- Local development server (due to CORS restrictions)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jeantimex/flights-tracker.git
   cd flights-tracker
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open in browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or your configured port)

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

## üîß Configuration

### Flight Data
- Located in `src/Data.js`
- Format: Array of objects with `departure`, `arrival`, and `speed` properties
- Coordinates in decimal degrees (latitude/longitude)

### Performance Tuning
- Adjust `maxFlightCount` in Controls.js for different datasets
- Modify `instancedPlanes` count for memory optimization
- Configure `pointsPerPath` in MergedFlightPaths.js for path detail

## üìä Performance Metrics

- **Rendering**: 60 FPS with 34,000+ flights on modern hardware
- **Memory**: ~200MB RAM usage for full dataset
- **Draw Calls**: Minimized to ~10 calls per frame
- **Optimization**: 90%+ performance improvement when elements hidden
